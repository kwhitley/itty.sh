  ## Terms and Conditions
  These terms and conditions (the "Terms") are a legal agreement between you and Itty Industries, Inc. ("itty.sh", "we", "us", or "our") governing your use of the itty.sh file-sharing app (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

  Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about your rights and obligations, as well as limitations and exclusions that may apply to you.

  ### Service
  The Service allows users to upload, share, and download files. The Service is currently in alpha, which means that it is still under development and may not be fully functional or may contain bugs. We make no guarantees about the availability or reliability of the Service, or about the storage or preservation of any files or content uploaded to the Service.

  During the alpha period, we may periodically purge content from the Service, potentially without notice. We will, however, try to advertise any planned purges on [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aTunhByeNY) in advance.

  ### Changes to the Service and these Terms
  We may change the Service or these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice through the Service, or updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to use the Service after we have changed these Terms or the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Terms or changes to the Service.
